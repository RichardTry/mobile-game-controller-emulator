Mobile Controller Emulator - Project Description:
    - Emulate joystick and gamepad like controls on a smart phone or any wifi capable touch screen device, transmit them over wifi to a pc and use the input for a controller emulator on the pc.

    Two main components:
        1. Mobile Device Controller Emulator:
            Receive input from touch screen a via widgets that emulate controller buttons and analog sticks, 
            and transmit them via wifi to the target host machine

        2. Target Device 




RESEARCH NOTES:
Look up uinput for linux
Look up libevdev for linux, recommended over uinput

SCTP PROTOCOL:
A protocol over TCP that is message oriented like UDP but ensures the reliability of TCP.

"Being message-oriented, SCTP transports a sequence of messages, rather than transporting an unbroken stream of bytes as does TCP. Like in UDP, in SCTP a sender sends a message in one operation, and that exact message is passed to the receiving application process in one operation. But unlike UDP, the delivery is guaranteed." - Qt QSctpSocket class documentation

Important Note:
Scratch that, SCTP isn't supported on windows without external libraries and QT online version is compiled with SCTP disabled.
Even if Qt is compiled with SCTP enabled it still doesn't support SCTP on widnows.


UDP Related look this up:
IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP, "Join a multicast group and allow receiving data only from a specified source" linux manual pages

IMPORTANT TIP WHEN SUBCLASSING QWIDGET
Make sure to implement the minimumSizeHint function, or the layouts will resize the widget to zero unless minimum size specified.
